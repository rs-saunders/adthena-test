Adthena Fullstack Developer Programming Test
========================

In this directory you will find everything you need to complete the Adthena coding test.

There are 2 main folders [test-api](test-api) and [test-client](test-client). We recommend opening each of those folders as a separate project in
your IDE (e. g. IntelliJ or VS Code).

More details about prerequisites, how to run the projects and other useful information can be found in the readme files in those folders.
